# Project Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the high-level architecture of our large-scale Node.js project. The project follows a modular, layered architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

## Key Components

### 1. Config
Contains configuration files for the application, database, and logger.

### 2. Core
Houses core functionalities, abstractions, and interfaces used across the application:
- Interfaces: Define contracts for repositories and services.
- Abstracts: Provide base implementations for repositories and services.
- Types: Define custom types used throughout the application.

### 3. Modules
Feature-specific modules following a modular architecture. Each module (e.g., user, auth, chat) contains:
- Models: Data models and schemas.
- Repositories: Data access layer.
- Services: Business logic layer.
- Controllers: Request handlers.
- Routes: API route definitions.
- Tests: Module-specific tests.

### 4. Shared
Contains shared utilities, middleware, and constants used across modules.

### 5. API
Defines API versioning and routing.

## Layered Architecture
The project follows a layered architecture within each module:
1. Routes: Define API endpoints.
2. Controllers: Handle requests and responses.
3. Services: Implement business logic.
4. Repositories: Handle data access and persistence.
5. Models: Define data structures.

## Data Flow
1. Request → 2. Route → 3. Controller → 4. Service → 5. Repository → 6. Database

## Key Design Patterns
- Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic.
- Dependency Injection: Used for loose coupling between layers.
- Singleton: Used for shared resources (e.g., database connection).

## Technology Stack
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js (assumed based on structure)
- Socket.io (for chat functionality)
- [Database technology, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL]
- Jest (for testing)

## Scalability Considerations
- Modular architecture allows for easy scaling of individual features.
- Separation of concerns facilitates maintenance and updates.
- API versioning supports backward compatibility.

## Security Measures
- Authentication module for user security.
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive data.
- [Add other security features implemented]

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components.
- Integration tests for testing module interactions.

## Deployment and DevOps
- Scripts for database migrations and seeding.
- Environment-specific configuration files.
